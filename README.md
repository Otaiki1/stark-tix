# StarkTix: Decentralized Ticketing on StarkNet 🎫

## Overview:

StarkTix is a decentralized ticketing system developed on the StarkNet platform to address scalability issues and enhance inclusivity in event participation. Built with the robust capabilities of StarkNet.js and Starknet React, StarkTix aims to revolutionize the event ticketing landscape, providing a seamless and secure experience for users.

## Purpose:

StarkTix is born out of a need to revolutionize the event ticketing landscape in our country. Organizing numerous events has exposed the flaws in traditional ticketing systems, resulting in financial losses due to system bypasses. StarkTix aims to leverage the power of StarkNet to create a secure and efficient ticketing solution, ensuring transparency, accessibility, and fraud prevention in the ticketing process.

## Project Components:

### 1. Smart Contract Architecture:
- StarkTix has its smart contracts on the StarkNet network.
- Smart contracts manage tokenized tickets, ensuring secure and efficient transactions.

### 2. Frontend Interaction:
- StarkTix's frontend interacts with the StarkNet network using Starknet React, offering a familiar development experience.
- Users connect their browser extension wallet (e.g., ArgentX, Braavos) to access their StarkNet accounts represented as contracts.

### 3. User Accounts and Signatures:
- Utilizing Starknet.js, StarkNet accounts are treated as contracts, allowing users to connect their wallets securely.
- Users sign messages and transactions using Starknet.js functions, ensuring verifiable and secure actions.

### 4. Provider for Network Interaction:
- StarkTix incorporates providers to interact with the StarkNet network, similar to Ethereum providers.
- Support for default providers and external services like Infura or Alchemy enhances network reliability.

### 5. StarkNet React Integration:
- StarkTix integrates Starknet React, an open-source collection of React providers and hooks, inspired by wagmi.
- Developers can seamlessly connect wallets, manage accounts, and interact with contracts using Starknet React.
