# StarkTix: Decentralized Ticketing on StarkNet 

## Overview:

StarkTix is a decentralized ticketing system that is being developed on the StarkNet platform to address scalability issues and enhance inclusivity in event participation. Built with the robust capabilities of StarkNet , StarkTix aims to revolutionize the event ticketing landscape, providing a seamless and secure experience for users.

## Purpose:

StarkTix is born out of a need to revolutionize the event ticketing landscape in our country. As someone in event planning , Organizing numerous events has exposed me to  the flaws in traditional ticketing systems, that has resulted in financial losses due to system bypasses. StarkTix aims to leverage the power of StarkNet to create a secure and efficient ticketing solution, ensuring transparency, accessibility, and fraud prevention in the ticketing process.

## Project Components:

### 1. Smart Contract Architecture:
- StarkTix has its smart contracts on the StarkNet network.
- Smart contracts manage tokenized tickets, ensuring secure and efficient transactions.

### 2. Frontend Interaction:
- StarkTix's frontend interacts with the StarkNet network using Starknet React, offering a familiar development experience.
- Users connect their browser extension wallet (e.g., ArgentX, Braavos) to access their StarkNet accounts represented as contracts.

### 3. User Accounts and Signatures:
- Users can connect their wallets securely.
- Users sign messages and transactions using Starknet.js functions, ensuring verifiable and secure actions.

### 4. Provider for Network Interaction:
- StarkTix incorporates providers to interact with the StarkNet network, similar to Ethereum providers.


### 5. StarkNet React Integration:
- StarkTix integrates Starknet React, an open-source collection of React providers and hooks, inspired by wagmi.
- Users can seamlessly connect wallets, manage accounts, and interact with contracts .

## Roadmap 

### Phase 1: Smart Contract Deployment and Testing

- Write Smart contracts using Cairo 
- Test smart contract functionality with StarkNet's testing tools. 
- Compile and deploy to testnet 

### Phase 2: Frontend Development

- Develop a React-based frontend using Starknet React for a responsive and intuitive user interface. 
- Implement account connection functionality, allowing users to connect their wallets. 

### Phase 3: User Interaction and Signatures

- Integrate user interaction, including signing messages and transactions.
- Ensure smooth and secure user interactions with the StarkNet accounts.

### Phase 4: Network Interaction and Provider Implementation

- Implement providers for interacting with the StarkNet network. 
- Choose between default providers or external services to enhance network reliability. 

### Phase 5: Unit Management and Data Transformation

- Ensure efficient data transformation and unit management.
- Ensure correct conversion of values .

### Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance

- Conduct thorough testing of the entire system, including smart contracts and frontend components.
- Address any vulnerabilities or issues identified during the testing phase.

### Phase 7: Deployment and User Onboarding

- Deploy the React-based frontend on a suitable hosting platform.
- Deploy smart contracts to the StarkNet mainnet.
- Develop educational resources/ docs  for users to understand the decentralized ticketing process.


## Conclusion

StarkTix aspires to revolutionize event ticketing by delivering a decentralized, scalable, and secure solution on the StarkNet platform. The project adheres to a well-defined roadmap, prioritizing smart contract development, user interaction, network integration, and community engagement. Leveraging the power of StarkNet, StarkTix aims to be a world-class decentralized ticketing system. This project also acts as a way to strengthen my skills developing on starknet while solving a real world problem, killing two birds with one stone .
